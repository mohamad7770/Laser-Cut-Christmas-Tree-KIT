Design and Fabrication of a Christmas Tree Model Using Laser Cutting Technology

Purpose: This report documents the complete practical journey of transforming a digital idea into a tangible product, aiming to enhance the hands-on understanding of digital fabrication and laser cutting technologies.

Detailed Work Stages (Methodology)
The project was executed in four sequential main stages:

Stage 1: Design

File Saving: The final design was saved in DXF format, the standard format for laser cutting machines as it contains vector data.

Stage 2: Preparation in CorelDRAW

Objective: Prepare the design file for the laser cutter.

Procedures:

The DXF file was opened in CorelDRAW software.

Defining Cut Paths: The color Red was assigned to all outlines intended for cutting, as the machine is configured to recognize this specific color for cutting operations.

Settings Configuration: The laser's speed and power settings were adjusted to suit the material type and thickness (3mm Plywood).

Stage 3: Machine Implementation

Objective: Execute the actual cutting process on the raw material.

Procedures:

Material Prep: A sheet of 3mm thick Plywood was used.

Material Fixation: The wood sheet was fixed flat and securely onto the machine's working bed.

Calibration: The distance between the laser head and the wood surface was precisely calibrated to ensure clean and effective cutting.

Setting the Start Point: The laser head was moved manually to set the starting point on the sheet.

Execution: After closing the protective lid, the 'Start' button was pressed to initiate the cutting process.

Part Extraction: After completion, parts were carefully removed from the bed after a brief wait.

Cleaning: The work bed was cleaned from residue and dust.

Stage 4: Assembly

Objective: Assemble the laser-cut pieces to form the final product.

Procedures:

The Christmas tree pieces were assembled according to the original design, utilizing the pre-designed interlocking slots and tabs, typically requiring no adhesive.

Results & Conclusions
Result: A precise and cleanly cut physical model of a Christmas tree was successfully produced, showcasing the high accuracy of laser technology.
